-Seperate codecs from applications
-Seperate developer tools from applications
	-Give a choice on what to install, what ide/editor etc?
	-BUT put komodo and gedit
-Seperate xfce4 shortcuts from everything else
-Make it clear that this is for ubuntu and debian


-Need error reporting if any of this fails and to say what fails

-automate mintstick

-auto install xampp to htdocs chown thingy

-replace all those if then fi with some sort of case switch style statements




__________________________________________________________________________________________
-Need to automatically install auto jump, aside from 

"This will install autojump but to use it you need to configure your shell to
 source autojump.sh on startup. If youâ€™re use Bash, then add the following line 
to your ~/.bashrc file. The same line will work for Zsh if you add it to ~/.zshrc."

I can append to the end of a file 

this command to be appended:

. /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh


~/.bashrc . /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh



echo ". /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

APPENDED!!!!
WORKS
