-Seperate codecs from applications
-Seperate developer tools from applications
	-Give a choice on what to install, what ide/editor etc?
	-BUT put komodo and gedit
-Seperate xfce4 shortcuts from everything else
-Make it clear that this is for ubuntu and debian


-Need error reporting if any of this fails and to say what fails

- auto install xampp to htdocs chown thingy

-replace all those if then fi with some sort of case switch style statements


# UI Features
- Y to continue should be case insensitive

# Apps To Add


__________________________________________________________________________________________
-Need to automatically install auto jump, aside from

"This will install autojump but to use it you need to configure your shell to
 source autojump.sh on startup. If youâ€™re use Bash, then add the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file. The same line will work for Zsh if you add it to ~/.zshrc."

I can append to the end of a file

this command to be appended:

. /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh


~/.bashrc . /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh



echo ". /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

APPENDED!!!!
WORKS



old notes






#an alternative of searching the user input, see "Why doesn't if [ echo $foo | grep -q bar ] work?"
#on stack exchange, you can use double brackets








#thunar is default file browser
#~/.config/openbox/autostart.sh is where the startup script
#generally /home/cina/.config/
#or /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart.sh

#to copy stuff
#sudo cp ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml
#

#note you need spaces between [ ]

#I am not sure if a case switch will do what I want
#I want it to be be letters
#might have to make it a function, and have the data passed
#function sorts the letters?
#then it would be a fixed number of options,
#but that might be a waste of time writing a scenario for each string combination possible
#There might be a way around that
#If I have like 15 options for example, I would have to write like 15*15 amount?
#what if it was a case switch but each switch had a function that would test on
#whether the letter was inside a string

#actually if else might be better anyway
#if there is a search function, I can use an if for whatever options there is
#then it would go through each condition and complete it
#I would only have to modify the if conditions
#and have a search function before each choice

#also spit out the users selection first
#The computer took in "abcd", are you sure?
#then after each installation print that it was installed.

#also make the options go with the option
#try to make them all one letter

#test out looper logic for confirmation



#    #if statements need to be changed to read strings not numbers
#    #search syntax
#    #if [[ $c == *sg* ]]; then echo "it worked"; fi
#    #^this is case sensitive tho
#    #might be better to use grep so it is case insensitive
#    #if echo $c | grep -iq z; then echo "it worked"; fi
#    #^That's case insensitive
#    #pipes variable into grep
#    #-i ignores case
#    #-q does not write anything to output by default
#    #but will search out of a string?
#    #yes
#    #need a way to append to a string that is in each of these statements
#    #and then print out that long string after all this
#    # use +=
#    # x="a"
#    # x+="b"
#    # echo $x
#    # ab
#    #               *SYNTAX*
#    #note that declaring variables requires no space
#    #but if statements do
#    #you don't need quotations for strings at all, but you can
#    #you can also put variables inside quotations, as long as you use $
##    
#    #how should I print it, new line for each?
#    #saying installed in each would be annoying
##    
#    #           Option names
#    #If you get too many options, multiples or have issue making option names
#    #might want to make some stuff case sensitive SO that they know where a phrase starts
#    #so Sa, As
#    #Thing is if you make something multi character
#    #but have a single character option
#    #then it'll get confused, if you have multiple strings that start
#    #with a single letter, then make all of them multicharacter
#    #You also have to watch out for phrases that end or start with certain characters
#    #for example if you have AS
#    #You probably shouldn't have SA?
#    #Maybe keep grep? this way if I want to expand search, it is easier
##    
###    
##echo -e "\e[1;34mThis is a blue text.\e[0m"
## you need -e for that as well as that code
