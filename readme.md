		Thank you Github user Pvaret for this fix.
		The repository is here: https://github.com/pvaret/rtl8192cu-fixes.git
		In his or her repository, it is noted that the following devices also work,
		the read me is included:
			- Belkin N300
			- TP-Link TL-WN823N
			- TRENDnet TEW-648UBM N150
		-The realtek and asus drivers are there as well as another fix but I couldn't get them to work
		either with stability or to even install. You are welcome to try them out though.
