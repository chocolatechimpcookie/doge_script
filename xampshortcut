I believe that you want to add a GUI xampp control panel. To add a GUI xampp control panel see below.

Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:

sudo gedit ~/.local/share/applications/xampp-control-panel.desktop

When the text editor opens simply paste the following, close and save.

[Desktop Entry]
Comment=Start and Stop XAMPP
Name=XAMPP Control Panel
Exec=sudo -i python /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel.py
Icon=/usr/share/icons/Humanity/devices/24/network-wired.svg
Encoding=UTF-8
Terminal=false
Name=XAMPP Control Panel
Comment=Start and Stop XAMPP
Type=Application
Icon=/usr/share/icons/Humanity/devices/24/network-wired.svg

If you have a problem with executing the program, install gksu, and in the forth line, replace sudo -i with gksudo. Below is how to install gksu if not installed, since it has been removed from 13.04.

sudo apt-get install gksu

Look for xampp control panel in dash
